You're almost done installing Django-RDF. You need three more steps:

1) Put this directory on the Python path.

   Or, if you prefer, you can create an rdf.pth file in your site-packages dir.
   The file should contain the absolute path to this directory, nothing more.

2) Add the Django-RDF app to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py, and add its templates 
   directory to TEMPLATE_DIRS.

3) Run the syncvb command to set up your vocabulary.

   cd <your project directory>
   ./manage.py syncvb
