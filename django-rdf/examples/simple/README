This is a simple example project, using a sqlite3 database. 

If you don't have sqlite you can install using macports on the Mac:

    sudo port install py25-sqlite3

Or similarly on any Debian-flavored Linux box:

    sudo apt-get install py25-sqlite3

Then, set up your shell environment:

    cd <...>/examples/simple
    source .bashrc

First try running the tests - there should be no failures or errors:

    ./manage.py test

Then boot the devserver:

    ./manage.py runserver

You should be up and running. Just point a browser at http://localhost:8000/.
