#summary Configuring Django-RDF
#labels Phase-Deploy,Featured

No modification to any existing code is required, and minimal configuration is necessary - the default behavior is sufficient for most apps, and can be enabled by

  # Placing the Django-RDF app source directory in the PYTHON_PATH
  # Expanding the ontology tarball into the Django-RDF/rdf/ontology/ directory
  # Adding INSTALLED_APPS, TEMPLATE_DIRS and SERIALIZATION_MODULES entries to settings.py
  # (Re)Running syncdb to generate the database schema elements for the RDF models
  # Running the "syncvb" command, to generate an RDF vocabulary from existing models 

Syncvb will print a code snippet that can be pasted into settings.py if the SERIALIZATION_MODULES are missing.
